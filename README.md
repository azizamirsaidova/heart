# ML-2: Trees, Model Interrogation and Bayesian Workflow

Homework 1: Harnessing data to help the heart!

Learning Goals:
We will look here into the practicalities of fitting classification trees, random forests, and boosted trees. These involve out-of-bound estimates and cross-validation, and how you might want to deal with hyperparameters in these models.

The homework is divided into four main parts:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset and data-preprocessing
3. Developing Baseline model using Logistic Regression
4. Working with different tree models
5. Comparing the models to check which performed better
